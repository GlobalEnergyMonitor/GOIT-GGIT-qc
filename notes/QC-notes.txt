For Hungary-Slovenia-Italy Interconnector Gas Pipeline (P1340):
Start country (spreadsheet): Hungary
End country (spreadsheet): Italy
However, found the end point in EEZ of Slovenia, at: 46.1899043, 14.4935662; minimum distance: 89.0.
Warning, this pipeline route has separate segments; may be branching or not in order.

>>> map looks correct but there's a semicolon in the coordinates; is that necessary?
NEEDS TO BE FIXED; currently it's likely overcounting the pipeline length...
